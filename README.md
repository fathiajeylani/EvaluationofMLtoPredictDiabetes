# EvaluationofMLtoPredictDiabetes

My project will be using a decision tree and random forest machine learning model to predict the occurence of diabetes. I also will evaluate the performance of the two in their accuracies. This will done using health markers that are known to have a relationship with the occurence. The markers are pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and age.
