# EvaluationofMLtoPredictDiabetes

My project will be using a decision tree and random forest machine learning model to predict the occurence of diabetes. I also will evaluate the performance of the two in their accuracies. This will done using health markers that are known to have a relationship with the occurence. The markers are pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and age. 

When looking at which variables had the highest correlation to the outcome, glucose, pregnancies, BMI, and age had the highest correlations. The heatmap below shows that

Evaluating the performance of the decision tree and random forest, the random forest performed better than the decision tree. 

The decision tree was very robust and even after decreasing the depth, the model actually had a worse performance.

In addition to the overall performance of the two models, confusion matrix and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to further evaluate the accuracies. Again with this evaluation, the random forest model performed better. Both the confusion matrix and AUC is shown below
